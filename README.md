# Soil-Classification-Model
Soil Classification model using different image filters for preprocessing for training models using like VGG19, VGG16 and SVM models to give the a comprehensive study of highest Accuracy. More attention has been given to Image Preprocessing since this is also a project of Image Processing; using filters like Gabor for feature extraction.
